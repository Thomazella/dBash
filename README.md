# dBash
Declarative bash

## Motivation

Bash is a great tool but it's started to show it's age.
It feels like working with quirky old machine you know all too well.
If only it could be better, smoother, easier to read, some of the boilerplate abstracted away...
Well, dBash is a step in that direction.
It's a collection of simple functions that aim to make your life easier.
